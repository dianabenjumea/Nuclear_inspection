# **docker-radiation-store**  
A Docker setup for using **MCAPL tools** with the **EEE radiation store Gazebo simulation**, facilitated throught **Docker Compose**.

---

## **How to Run This Project**  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
First, clone the repository to your local environment:  

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dianabenjumea/nuclear_inspection.git
cd nuclear_inspection
```

### **2. Build and start the Containers with Docker Compose**  
### Running the Containers
Instead of manually building and running the container, use `docker-compose` to handle everything:

Build the necessary images (if not already built):

```sh
docker compose build --no-cache
```

Start the containers in detached mode (`-d` flag):
```sh
docker compose up -d
```

### Stopping the Containers
To stop all running containers:

```sh
docker compose down
```



<!--
### **2. Build the Docker Image**  
Use one of the following commands to build your Docker image:  

#### **Using `docker build`**
```sh
docker build -t YOUR_IMAGE_NAME:YOUR_IMAGE_TAG .
```

#### **Using `docker buildx` (for different architectures)**
- **For amd64**  
  ```sh
  docker buildx build --platform=linux/amd64 --progress=plain -t YOUR_IMAGE_NAME:YOUR_IMAGE_TAG .
  ```
- **For arm64**  
  ```sh
  docker buildx build --platform=linux/arm64 --progress=plain -t YOUR_IMAGE_NAME:YOUR_IMAGE_TAG .
  ```

> Replace `YOUR_IMAGE_NAME` and `YOUR_IMAGE_TAG` with your preferred image name and tag.

#### **Example (What I'm Running)**
```sh
docker buildx build --platform=linux/amd64 --progress=plain -t ros-noetic:radiation-storage .
```

---

### **3. Run the Docker Container**  
Start the container and expose it on port **6080**:

```sh
docker run -p 6080:80 --security-opt seccomp=unconfined --shm-size=512m --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME IMAGE:VERSION
```

> Replace `YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME` with your desired container name.

#### **Example (What I'm Running)**
```sh
docker run -p 6080:80 --security-opt seccomp=unconfined --shm-size=512m --name radiation-storage ros-noetic:radiation-storage
```

-->

### **3. Access the Container UI**  
Once the container is running, open your browser and go to:
ðŸ‘‰ **[http://localhost:6080/](http://localhost:6080/)**

## **Running the Gazebo Radiation Demonstration**  


1. Navigate to the catkin workspace and build:  
   ```sh
   cd catkin_ws/ && catkin_make
   source devel/setup.bash
   ```

2. Start the simulation:  
   ```sh
   cd src/gazebo_radiation_plugin/launch/
   roslaunch radiation_demonstrator.launch
   ```

3. Open another terminal run the teleoperation:  
   ```sh
   rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py
   ```

With the teleoperation terminal open, press one of the **commands displayed on the screen** (e.g., `i`), and you should see the robot moving in both **RViz** and **Gazebo**.

## **MCAPL Setup in IntelliJ**  

### **1. Open IntelliJ**
Run IntelliJ from the terminal:  
```sh
intellij
```
Then, open the **MCAPL** project.

### **2. Build the Project**
- Use the **Ant** plugin to build the project (click the **Ant symbol** in the top-right corner of IntelliJ).  
- Ensure there are **no errors**.

### **3. Test MCAPL Installation**
Run simple example programs in `src/examples` as described in the **[MCAPL manual â€“ Chapter 3](https://github.com/mcapl/mcapl/tree/master/doc/manual)**.

## **Java_rosbridge Setup**  

> **Note**  
> The `java_rosbridge` folder is already updated, and the `.jar` file has been integrated into the MCAPL framework.  
> These setup steps are still included in case you need to modify the `.jar` file, such as when adding support for more messages between Gwendolen and ROS.  
> If you're using the current `.jar` and do not need any changes, you can skip directly to the [MCAPL and ROS Bridge Setup](#mcapl-and-ros-bridge-setup) section.


1. Navigate to the `java_rosbridge` directory:  
   ```sh
   cd java_rosbridge
   ```

2. Compile the project:  
   ```sh
   mvn compile
   ```

3. Create the target `.jar` file and Java documentation:  
   ```sh
   mvn package
   ```

### **Java_rosbridge Integration with MCAPL**
After running the above commands, a new folder named **`target`** will be created in the **`java_rosbridge`** project. Inside this folder, you'll find the **`.jar`** file that needs to be included in the **MCAPL** project as a library.  

**Note:** You will want to rename the java_rosbridge-2.0.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar to java_rosbridge_all.jar and replace it in the MCAPL lib-3rd party folder.

This enables communication between **Gwendolen** and **ROS (via ROS Bridge)**.  
> If you're adding additional messages, modify the `.jar` file accordingly.

---

## **MCAPL and ROS Bridge Setup**  

1. Start the simulation (same as before, but no need for teleoperation this time).  
2. Open IntelliJ:  
   ```sh
   intellij
   ```
3. In IntelliJ, open the **MCAPL** project and navigate to:  
   ```
   src/examples/gwendolen/compositional/rain/remote_inspection
   ```
4. Right-click **`remote-inspection.ail`** â†’ **Run As > Run Configurations**
